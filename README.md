This app was developed for a hospital. Especially for the dialysis section. This app was very specific for the staff to evaluate their earnings and stocks management.

Functionality:
This app has two sections one is for admins to see all the records for today's sales, yesterday's sales, and custom timeframe query, add new technicians to the app, and add more stock to the inventory. Stock consists of dialyzers and injections as it is specifically for the dialysis section.
And the other section was for technicians where technicians add new patients and can treat the patients who are previously registered. Every time the technician treats the patient he adds the total charges and equipment used. Tech generates a bill and prints it through a Bluetooth printer. then a notification is generated to the admin so the admin can keep the records.
Every time equipment is used it will affect the inventory records.

Output:
I have added its screenshots to the Screenshots folder you can open and see it.

Customizations:
This app will be altered and customized according to your requirements just make a connection with the Developer.
